# DeFi Yield Farming DApp â›“

This project was to just get the basic understanding of how to code smart contracts on Solidity. Then using Truffle suit to test and deploy the contracts on Ganache, a local Eth Blockchain for testing purposes. 

## What can you do?
Here you can deposit Mock DAI (mDAI) tokens for staking and yield DApp tokens. So if you deposit 100 mDAI, you will receive 100 DApp tokens in about a week.

## Final Thought...
I loved Solidity. It's very similar to Java and I was able to pick it up quite quickly. With my goal of being an end-to-end developer (from UI/UX -> Frontend -> Backend -> Database/Blockchain) I have gotten closer to the end of this journey. The final piece of the puzzle **UI/UX**.
